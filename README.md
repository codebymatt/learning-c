# Learning C

I've been wanting to learn C for a while, and since I currently don't have any
major projects I want to jump right into I've decided to learn it from the
ground up. I do think it's a pretty good language to have in your arsenal, even
if you never use it. 

That being said, I'm not striving for perfection in thses solutions. I
haven't painstakenly refactored code or tweaked outputs, so don't expect
beautiful code should you poke through the project. I have however kept it
readable and sensible, because even if it's a small project one needs to
maintain pride in their work.

All code compiles using GCC on Mac OSX (High Sierra).
