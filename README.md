# Learning C

I've been wanting to learn C for a while, and since I currently don't have any
major projects I want to jump right into I've decided to learn it from the
ground up. I do think it's a pretty good language to have in my arsenal, even
if I don't use it professionally.

That being said, I'm not striving to write code for future use in these solutions. I
haven't painstakenly refactored code or tweaked outputs, so don't expect
perfection should you poke through the project. I have however kept it
readable and sensible, because even if it's a small project one needs to
maintain pride in their work.

All code compiles using GCC on Mac OSX (High Sierra).

### Epilogue
This took longer than it should have, mainly because I got bored. Still, I managed to slowly push
through (with the caveat of just completing chapters 1 through 6 since they're the ones that cover
the key language features).

I definitely feel like I have a decent *theoretical* grasp of the C language now, albeit at a 
basic level. While I don't intend to write any more C anytime soon, I've definitely stretched my 
ability to program, and have gotten a MUCH better knowledge of certain concepts. For example, while 
I understood pointers conceptually before, I know how to USE pointers properly now. I've also 
cracked the window into the underlying OS a tiny bit open (the pointers helped with that), and 
better understand how memory works. I've definitely gained a lot (more) respect for more low 
level, bare to the metal engineers.

So long, and here's to no more segmentation faults!
