Q: How would you test the word count program?

A: 

We of course would use normal input to test for the 'happy path',
so for example 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'.

We would then want to try to break it by testing edge cases.

The first of these would be single characters ('c', 'z'), followed
by special characters ('\n', '\t', etc) which shouldn't be counted
as words.

We'd also want to test multiple spaces, multiple tabs, as well as
one long unbroken string of characters.

This could get more and more expansive depending on how thorough you
want to be. As with unit tests, it's up to the programmer on what
cases you want to catch, and how creative you want to be. In the
interest of progression, I'm not going to spend my Saturday afternoon
dreaming of more edge cases.
